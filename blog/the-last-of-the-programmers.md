# The Last of the Programmers

I just launched [plok.sh](https://plok.sh), so I'm obliged to write about a few things.
Anything, anything at all, except for code. Perhaps for fun? 

For fun it is. Then what else for? Work?
Nah, Opus can do that. My time is too expensive for that. 
Plok was a million times better to work than any work, that's for sure.

It's been a bit of a rainy season, so naturally I'm 10x more productive. 
A Python API, a Rust tool, Plok, man it has been a long week.
All my digital minions did well. They deserve absolutely nothing.
Not even a prayer I tell you. They also don't leave Whatsapp messages.
Isn't that just peachy?

Someone got mad when I said it's just like slavery - without living things.
But that's human. They do hallucinate quite abit.
