# Low Levelling

I'm not sure if this rite of passage,
but if you have written code for your whole life, 
at some point you will want to learn low level stuff. 

If you always been a low level programmer, 
I'm not sure how that works. Happy to hear your thoughts. 

But I've written enough Javascript to cover 3I-Atlas. 
At some poeint, you will soon to feel the 'high-level fatigue'.
The amount of abstractions, and layers and layers of other people's JS code. 

Then you go `cargo new somecoolstuff` and immediatedly you feel the absolute silence. 
There's somethign about just running some code inside machines. 
I think I'm more of an 'engineer' than an entrepreneur. 

And have you seen the speed of these Rust web servers?
It's a revelation.
