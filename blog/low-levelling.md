# Low Levelling

I'm not sure if this is a rite of passage,
but if you have written code for your whole life, 
at some point you will want to learn low level stuff. 

If you had been a low level programmer, 
I'm not sure how that works. Happy to hear your thoughts. 

But I've written enough Javascript to cover 3I-Atlas. 
At some point, you will soon feel the 'high-level fatigue'.
The amount of abstractions, and layers and layers of other people's JS code. 

Then you go `cargo new somecoolstuff` and immediatedly you feel the absolute silence. 
There's something about just running some code in machines.

And have you seen the speed of these Rust web servers?
It's a revelation.
