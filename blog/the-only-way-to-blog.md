# The Only Way To Blog

Finally managed to get [plok.sh](https://plok.sh) done.
I've already tried to blog in the past, and my attempts usually end in a few unpublished .md files.

I always wanted something simple, easy to manage, without any tech bloat. 
And I never really cared about being 'discovered'.

I could have always used a number of solutions.
But it would be cool, if I can hide behind a 'public' domain instead of my own.

But I didn't wanna deal with a CMS or a web text editor.
So the solution was something to do with markdown.

Ah, github. Might as well? 

Enjoy blogging devs.
