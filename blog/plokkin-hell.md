# Plokkin Hell

So the Product Hunt launch went well. Plok got P3!
It isn't much of a competition yes, but it felt great. 

I'm thinking to add image asset support, and probably a better OG image generation.
Perhaps next week. 

Someone in the comments on PH said Plok reminded them of Jekyll from back in the days. 
Oh yea, for sure. Jekyll, Gastby. Those were our solution to make the web fast. 

Plok is just one more level simpler. 
People are already asking for multiuser, bla bla, custom domains etc. 
It's not the mechanism per se, more along the lines of do we really need all this?

I'm keen on keeping Plok for devs. Who else uses Github?
